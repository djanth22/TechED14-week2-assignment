Optional
-🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

-Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
-What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g YouTube tutorials)?
-What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
-What went really well and what could have gone better?

requirements I achieved would be using media queries to make the site design responsive though i will say i could have done a much better job by adding more, appropriate alt tags on my images for accessibility and the buttons on the page respond well changing the images to the next or the previous one through the use oif functions and event handlers.

that last requirement was quite difficult for me especially getting everything to work properly, but i still dont have the thumbnails working correctly when clicked. my attempts have been removed from the javascript file for the purpose of the page not having any issues but I couldnt seem to get it working. maybe its the way i chose to approach the assignment and the functions I used or perhaps I simply need more practice and understanding within workshops or demos to help me understand better. That one thing took up most of my time trying to figure out and frankly, almost drove me a little mad.
